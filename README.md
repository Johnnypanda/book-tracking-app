# MyReads Project

This project is a part of a UDACITY FEND course (React section). I was provided with the starting template (CSS, HTM, BooksAPI functionality) and had a task to make an APP work following requirements. 

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
